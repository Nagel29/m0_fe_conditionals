1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
  # I only estimated an hour. I definitely underestimated it. I did get hung up on one issue (mentioned in slack), but even without that, I think it would've still been longer than an hour.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
  # I feel pretty good about this lesson for now actually. There's a lot to dive deeper into I'm sure, but I feel good about what was covered.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
  # Was there an alternative to using "%" on the mild and medium exercises? If so, is something else a better option? I can do some googling to look at other options.
